# Decentralized Todo List Backend Wrapper

* I wanted to try and play with solidity. So, I created a very generic Todo list with full CRUDL endpoints.

# Tech Stack

* Solidity
* Ganache
* Truffle
* Flask
* Flask ReSTful

# Usage
1. First, install the truffle framework and ganache-cli
* ```npm install -g truffle```

2. Migrate and compile the contracts
* ```truffle migrate --compile-all```

3. Run the server
* ```shell
pipenv shell
python app.py
  ```
